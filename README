Various Boost Examples that I've accumulated.

Some of Boost's (excellent!) documentation can be a bit dense at times and a
simple example is often all that's needed to get rolling. Here is my public
repo that documents some of my random Boost meanderings.

I make use of a .cshrc file that sources a .enter.tcsh if it has the correct
ownership and permissions. This is very handy for setting environment
variables such as BOOST_INCDIR, which is referenced throughout various
Makefiles.

To review, download or learn more about my .cshrc file, see:

	https://raw.github.com/sean-/cshrc/master/.cshrc

for details or download it directly:

	curl -o ~/.cshrc # fetch -o ~/.cshrc https://raw.github.com/sean-/cshrc/master/.cshrc
	exec /bin/tcsh # Once ~/.cshrc has been reviewed to your satisfaction!!
	chsh /bin/tcsh # When ready to ditch bash
