Boost.Pimpl examples.

Documentation:
	http://drdobbs.com/cpp/205918714

Compile:
	make

Notes:
	Try the following set of commands to understand the benefits for
	development:

	% touch pimpl_example_pointer.h
	% make  # Note: Everything gets recompiled
	% touch pimpl_example_pointer.cc
	% make # Note: Only pimpl_example_pointer.o is regenerated
	% touch pimpl_example_pointer_impl.cc
	% make # Note: Only pimpl_example_pointer_impl.o is regenerated

Installation Notes: I have included a version of Boost.Pimpl from the vault
	since it appears to be down at the time of writing. The only
	difference between the copy here and the "official" version in the
	fault is I moved my copy of Boost.Pimpl in to
	$BOOST_INCDIR/boost/pimpl/ and fixed up the various #include paths to
	match. For the purposes of demoing or using Pimpl, just copy
	boost/pimpl to your boost include directory:

	% cp -prv boost/pimpl $BOOST_INCDIR/boost/

	GCC's LTO[1,2] is particularly appealing when possibly used in
	conjunction with Pimpl. I haven't had great success with LTO yet[3],
	but it is a technology that I'm keeping my eye on (and am anxiously
	hoping that llvm adds LTO as well).
