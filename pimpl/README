Boost.Pimpl examples.

Compile:
	make

Notes:
	Try the following set of commands to understand the benefits for
	development:

	% touch pimpl_example_pointer.h
	% make  # Note: Everything gets recompiled
	% touch pimpl_example_pointer.cc
	% make # Note: Only pimpl_example_pointer.o is regenerated
	% touch pimpl_example_pointer_impl.cc
	% make # Note: Only pimpl_example_pointer_impl.o is regenerated

Installation Notes: I moved my copy of Boost.Pimpl in to
	$BOOST_INCDIR/boost/pimpl/ and fixed up the various #include paths to
	match.

	GCC's LTO[1,2] is particularly appealing when possibly used in
	conjunction with Pimpl. I haven't had great success with LTO yet[3],
	but it is a technology that I'm keeping my eye on (and am anxiously
	hoping that llvm adds LTO as well).
